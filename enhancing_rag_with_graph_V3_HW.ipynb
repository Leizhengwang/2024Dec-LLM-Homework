        "\n",
        "Graph retrieval augmented generation (Graph RAG) is gaining momentum and emerging as a powerful addition to traditional vector search retrieval methods. This approach leverages the structured nature of graph databases, which organize data as nodes and relationships, to enhance the depth and contextuality of retrieved information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Graphs are great at representing and storing heterogeneous and interconnected information in a structured manner, effortlessly capturing complex relationships and attributes across diverse data types. In contrast, vector databases often struggle with such structured information, as their strength lies in handling unstructured data through high-dimensional vectors. In your RAG application, you can combine structured graph data with vector search through unstructured text to achieve the best of both worlds, which is exactly what we will do in this blog post.\n",
        "\n",
        "Knowledge graphs are great, but how do you create one? Constructing a knowledge graph is typically the most challenging step in leveraging the power of graph-based data representation. It involves gathering and structuring the data, which requires a deep understanding of both the domain and graph modeling. To simplify this process, we have been experimenting with LLMs. LLMs, with their profound understanding of language and context, can automate significant parts of the knowledge graph creation process. By analyzing text data, these models can identify entities, understand the relationships between them, and suggest how they might be best represented in a graph structure. As a result of these experiments, we have added the first version of the graph construction module to LangChain, which we will demonstrate in this blog post.\n",

The easiest way is to start a free instance on [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/), which offers cloud instances of Neo4j database. Alternatively, you can also set up a local instance of the Neo4j database by downloading the Neo4j Desktop application and creating a local database instance."
